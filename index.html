            <p>I have always wanted to be a writer. Ever since I was little, stories have spilled out of my head and onto whatever pages I could get my hands on to. I always thought maybe someday I would publish them, but I didn't have a lot of hopes for my silly ideas.</p>
            <p>Then my brother encouraged, cheered, pushed me to really try and get my stories out into the world. I finally submitted my fantasy adventure story to Kyanite Press, a fantasy and science fiction magazine, and it was accepted!</p>
            <p>With one publishing credit under my belt I grew bolder, and I submitted a novel to the same press, which also published books. They also accepted that, and I was over the moon. I have a real book, in print, and people liked it. It's not a huge blockbuster or anything, but it was a big accomplishment.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the press closed at the end of 2020, but I was able to get the rights to my novel back and have published it myself, as well as the sequel. You can see more about these stories below. I hope to have four books in the series, before moving on to the other crazy stories in my head.</p>
